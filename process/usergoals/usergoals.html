            <li>How will your users understand the content of the project?</li>
            <p>The users will understand the content of the project through a mini introduction on the main page of the site. It will explain the process and intent of the site initially to the user and possibly even have step by step processes of how the user should go about using the site.</p>

            <li>How will your users understand the primary objectives?</li>
            <p>The users will understand the primary objectives through introductions on the main page of the site which will help them know why they are here and what they can take away from this website. But at the same time, I want to keep the design of the page simple enough so that the intentions of the site are self-explanatory.</p>
            
            <li>What content and features do your users need, and in what form do they need it?</li>
            <p>The users will need a drop down menu that will list out emphasis' within the major that will then lead them to different pages suggesting different career options. The users will also need a section specific to resources relating to the specific career or industry because this site will help suggest options to explore and give brief descriptions but it won't go into complete detail of the career or job position. The user will then need to do more research on their own but we can provide the resources for them to do more research.</p>
            
            <li>How do your users think your interactive projects should work and what are their experience levels with the type of media you or your team is creating?</li>
            <p>I think the site will be fairly simple and intuitive to use and will be just like any other "exploration" website to use. The only thing is that the user will most likely need to read carefully about each option they click, because there could possibly be a lot of click opportunities going on leading to page after page.</p>
