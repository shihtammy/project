                The first time I created this storyboard, I didn't quite understand the process of it. I fell under the impression that we were drafting out how the site would look in terms up usability and the transitions between each page with the user. Then after a few more attempts and clarifications, I realized that its literally a storyboard telling the story of how the user will encounter it, and go about using the site. <br/><br/>
                So for my storyboards, initially my user would have a realization that he/she is graduating soon and needs to find a job or figure out what they want to do or pursue in the future. But they have no idea where to start. A friend then tells the friend that there's this awesome resource called the "UC Davis Design Career Exploration Tool" that let's you explore your career options in the design field. This will help users and students tremendously because it can essentially introduce students to many different positions and fields that design is involved in that they never knew about. This site would mainly be the surface and entry level of introductions into design options which would then help the user narrow down their interests. Then afterwards, the student will walk away with interests in mind and do more research on their own.
